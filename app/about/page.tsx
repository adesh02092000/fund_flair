      <h2>How Does Crowdfunding Work?</h2>
      <p>
        When you join our crowdfunding platform, you'll need to create a profile
        and set up your campaign. In your campaign, you'll share your story,
        explain why you're raising funds, and set a fundraising goal. Once your
        campaign is live, you can start promoting it to attract backers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Depending on the type of crowdfunding site you choose, you may have a
        specific campaign duration, such as 30 days or longer. During this
        period, you can start collecting funds from your backers. The funds will
        be deposited directly into the financial institution account you link to
        your fundraising account upon registration.
      </p>
